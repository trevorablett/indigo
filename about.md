[![Trevor demonstrating the "Thing"]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.about-pic }})]({{ site.url }})


<p>Hello! My name is Trevor Ablett, and I'm a PhD student at the University of Toronto in the <a href="http://starslab.ca" target="_blank">Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab</a> (STARS). I am being advised by <a href="http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/~jkelly/" target="_blank">Jonathan Kelly</a>. My research interests include machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics. I am currently investigating methods for applying imitation learning and machine learning to manipulators to allow them to complete multiple tasks with a single policy.</p>

<p> I'm originally from Thornhill, Ontario, in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto" target="_blank">this</a>). I've previously completed a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at McMaster University in <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Hamilton,+ON/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x882c986c27de778f:0x2b6aee56d8df0e21?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidksHqoOzaAhWq54MKHeckBVIQ8gEI3gEwEg" target="_blank">the Hammer</a>.</p>

<p> When I'm not working on research or progamming, you can usually find me engaging in some kind of physical activity (though I have preference for soccer and basketball), jamming out on either of my Lariv√©e or Strat, or working on my forever-rusty car.
