[![Trevor demonstrating the "Thing"]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.about-pic }})]({{ site.url }})


<p>Hello! My name is Trevor Ablett, and I'm a PhD student at the University of Toronto in the <a href="https://starslab.ca">Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab</a> (STARS). I am being advised by <a href="http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/~jkelly/">Jonathan Kelly</a>. My research interests include machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics. I am currently investigating methods for applying imitation learning and machine learning to manipulators to allow them to complete multiple tasks with a single policy.</p>

<p> I'm originally from Thornhill, Ontario, in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area, not Grand Theft Auto)
